## fibonacci

Write a function, _fibonacci_, that takes in a number argument, _n_, and returns the _n_-th number of the Fibonacci sequence.

The 0-th number of the sequence is 0.

The 1-st number of the sequence is 1.

To generate further numbers of the sequence, calculate the sum of previous two numbers.

You must solve this recursively.

#### test_00:
```python
fibonacci(0); # -> 0
```

#### test_01:
```python
fibonacci(1); # -> 1
```

#### test_02:
```python
fibonacci(2); # -> 1
```

#### test_03:
```python
fibonacci(3); # -> 2
```

#### test_04:
```python
fibonacci(4); # -> 3
```

#### test_05:
```python
fibonacci(5); # -> 5
```

#### test_06:
```python
fibonacci(8); # -> 21
```
